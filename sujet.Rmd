# Introduction

The goal of this exercise is to recreate the pipeline showned in Figure 1 represented by its DAG

![Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of the desired pipeline. Ellipses represent processes, arrows represents channels](/Users/Maxime/Documents/Github-ParisDiderot-Bioinfo/nextflow-intro/img/desired_pipeline.png)

# Channel factory

You may want to use the have a look at the `fromFilePairs` methods to create the channel when working with paired end data

# Mapping 

The mapping command to use is the following:


```bash
insert mapping command here
```

# Samtools view

The goal is to convert the `sam` file into a compressed binary `bam` file using `samtools view`

The samtools command to use is the following:

```bash
samtools view -S -b input.sam > output.bam
```

# Samtools sort
The goal is to sort the reads mapped on the reference genome by position

The samtools command to use us the following:

```bash
samtools sort input.bam > output.sorted.bam
```

# Bedtools
The goal is to compute the coverage of the reference genome provided with the aligned reads

The bedtools command to use is the following:

```bedtools
insert bedtools command here
```
